OchUploader
==============

Automated upload-tool (very early development) with the following features:
* Modularity and therefore expendability (add new hosters easily)
* Automated file-injection (searches for new directories to upload in a given base directory)
* Automated re-upload of files which are down
* Nice visual representation due to WPF and MahApps.Metro

The project is divided into several subprojects in order to be provide a GUI-agnostic, cross-platform backend and the 
opportunity to develop several frontends.
